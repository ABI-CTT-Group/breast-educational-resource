Normal healthy breast tissue contains lobules, ducts, ligaments, adipose/fat and fibrous glandular tissue. The breast also has lymph nodes and a lymph drainage system and the muscular chest wall and ribs behind.

Breast tissue is affected by hormones, during the menstrual cycle, pregnancy and after birth. The main hormones active through the menstrual cycle are oestrogen and progesterone.

The breast can produce milk from the lobules, which travels via the ducts to the nipple when breastfeeding.

A tumour in the breast can be benign (usually not life-threatening) or malignant (cancerous). Although a benign tumour may cause problems as it grows, it does not spread to other parts of the body. On the other hand, a malignant tumour does have the potential to grow and spread to form secondary tumours. When this happens, it's called advanced, metastatic or secondary breast cancer.
